/home/ubuntu/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/bitsandbytes/autograd/_functions.py:315: UserWarning: MatMul8bitLt: inputs will be cast from torch.bfloat16 to float16 during quantization
  warnings.warn(f"MatMul8bitLt: inputs will be cast from {A.dtype} to float16 during quantization")
The attention layers in this model are transitioning from computing the RoPE embeddings internally through `position_ids` (2D tensor with the indexes of the tokens), to using externally computed `position_embeddings` (Tuple of tensors, containing cos and sin). In v4.46 `position_ids` will be removed and `position_embeddings` will be mandatory.
